				<p>Using AngularJS and the Spotify API, I created an application that allows users to select an artist and guess which song is playing from a random sample taken from Spotify. They then can choose to play again using the same artist, play using a similar artist, or search again. Click on the image above to walk through a working version, or check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/jackw117/spotify-template">here</a>.</p>
